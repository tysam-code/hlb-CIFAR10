## CIFAR10 hyperlightspeedbench
Welcome to the hyperlightspeedbench CIFAR-10 (HLB-CIFAR10) repo.

### How to Run


`git clone https://github.com/tysam-code/hlb-CIFAR10 && cd hlb-CIFAR10 && python main.py`

Requires CUDA. Can be modified for other platforms with mild difficulty.

If you don't have torch and/or torchvision installed, please run:

`python -m pip install -r requirements.txt` after cd-ing into the hlb-CIFAR10 folder, then `python main.py` instead.

If you're curious, this code is generally Colab friendly (in fact -- most of this was developed in Colab!). Just be sure to uncomment the reset block at the top of the code.


### Main

Goals: 

* minimalistic
* beginner-friendly
* torch- and python-idiomatic
* hackable 
* few external dependencies (currently only torch and torchvision)
* ~world-record single-GPU training time (this repo holds the current world record at ~<7 (!!!) seconds on an A100, down from ~18.1 seconds originally).
* <2 seconds training time in <2 years (yep!)

This is a neural network implementation of a very speedily-training network that originally started as a painstaking reproduction of [David Page's original ultra-fast CIFAR-10 implementation on a single GPU](https://myrtle.ai/learn/how-to-train-your-resnet/), but written nearly from the ground-up to be extremely rapid-experimentation-friendly. Part of the benefit of this is that we now hold the world record for single GPU training speeds on CIFAR10, for example.

What we've added:
* custom architecture that is somehow even faster
* way too much hyperparameter tuning
* miscellaneous architecture trimmings (see the patch notes)
* memory format changes (and more!) to better use tensor cores/etc
* dirac initializations on non-depth-transitional layers (information passthrough on init)
* and more!

This code, in comparison to David's original code, is in a single file and extremely flat, but is not as durable for long-term production-level bug maintenance. You're meant to check out a fresh repo whenever you have a new idea. It is excellent for rapid idea exploring -- almost everywhere in the pipeline is exposed and built to be user-friendly. I truly enjoy personally using this code, and hope you do as well! :D Please let me know if you have any feedback. I hope to continue publishing updates to this in the future, so your support is encouraged. Share this repo with someone you know that might like it!

### Known Bugs

The Colab-specific code is commented out at the top, and the timing/performance table reprints the entire table instead of appropriately updating in-place each epoch.

### Why a ConvNet Still? Why CIFAR10? Aren't Transformers the New Thing Now?


Transformers are indeed the new thing, but I personally believe that the way information condenses from a training set into a neural network will still practically always follow the same underlying set of mathematical principles. The goal for this codebase is to get training in under two (2) seconds within a year or two (2), and under one (1) seconds within 4-5 years. This should allow for some very interesting scaled experiments for different techniques on a different kind of level. I have a rough path planned down to about 2-3 seconds of training or so, all things working out as they should. It will likely get very, very difficult beyond that point.

Basically -- the information gained from experimenting with a technique here should translate in some kind of a way. No need to scale up size arbitrarily when looking to suss out the basics of certain applied mathematical concepts for a problem.


### Submissions

Currently, submissions to this codebase as a benchmark are closed as we figure out the level of interest, how to track disparate entries, etc. Feel free to open an issue if you have thoughts on this!

#### Bugs & Etc.

If you find a bug, open an issue! L:D If you have a success story, let me know! It helps me understand what works and doesn't more than you might expect -- if I know how this is specifically helping people, that can help me further improve as a developer, as I can keep that in mind when developing other software for people in the future. :D :)
